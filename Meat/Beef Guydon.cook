Add some @oil{2%tbsp} in a frying pan, medium heat. Add the @onions{3} finely sliced in the pan until golden, for about 10 minutes max.

Add the @beef skirt{450%g} finely sliced (max 5cm long) and the @sugar{2%tsp} in the pan and cook until the meat is brown.

Add the @mirin or white vinegar{1%tbsp}, the @rice wine{1%tbsp}, the @dark soy sauce{1%tbsp}, the @light soy sauce{1%tbsp} and the @chicken stock{1/2%cube} in @water{450%ml}. Leave it slow heat for about 10 minutes to reduce into a thicker sauce.

You can also prepare some fried eggs on the side. Usually good to have the beef with some jasmin rice, it'll absord the sauce.
